# Ali Rostami's Website

This is my personal website. It is written using [Astro](https://astro.build/)
and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It extensively uses markdown format
for rendering pages and blog posts. The markdown files are exported out of my
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault.

I used the amazing
[Flexoki 2.0 Color Pallete](https://github.com/kepano/flexoki) and the design is
also heavily inspired by [Steph Ango's Website](https://stephango.com/).

The [alirostami.me](https://alirostami.me/) website is hosted on
[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
