## My First Blog Post

So, I made a little website for myself and I plan to write blog posts every week
and share anything interesting I learn with the community. The website is
written with Astro and it is hosted on Cloudflare Pages. You can checkout out
the code (altough it's fairly simple) on
[Github](https://github.com/alirostami1/website).

There is Also an [RSS feed](https://alirostami.me/feed.xml) available.

Let's Go!
