# About Me

I am *Ali Rostami*. I am currently experimenting with different fields of computer science to find what interests me most. I already have professional experience in several areas, including front-end development, back-end development, and embedded systems development, which I worked on in my previous roles.

I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Computational Engineering at [FAU](https://www.fau.eu/), where I am exploring computational methods and their applications in engineering.

I am passionate about learning and enjoy working on projects that combine creativity and technology. Lately, I’ve been focusing on parallel computing, numerical linear algebra, and game development.
