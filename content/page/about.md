# About Me

Hello! I'm Ali Rostami. I was born in 2000 and now doing an [M.Sc. in
Computational Engineering](https://www.fau.eu/studiengang/computational-engineering-msc/)
at [FAU](https://www.fau.de/). My love for computers started with video games.
by fifteen I was writing C/C++ and designing Arduino‑based alarm systems.

Since then I’ve experimented with many technologies and development stacks,
from building React front-ends to running Node.js an MongoDB Backend services.
At my first job I have been a key part of the team that carried-out the
migration from a monolithic Node.js app to a distributed Go microservices.
I still enjoy Go every day, whether I’m working a web API or a CLI tool.
Currently, as a Research Assistant, I mostly work with C++ and Matlab on
high-performance computing and simulation projects.
I live on Linux, code in Neovim, and automate everything with Bash scripts.

At FAU I am currently focusing on parallel computing, computer graphics,
and computer vision. and after hours I tinker with game development ideas
or home automation and hardware related stuff.
