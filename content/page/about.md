# About Me

Hello! I'm Ali Rostami. I was born in 2000 and now doing an M.Sc. in Computational Engineering at FAU. My love for computers started with video games. by fifteen I was writing C++ and wiring an Arduino‑based alarm.

Since then I’ve moved from building React front ends to running back ends. I have been a key part of the team that carried-out the migration from a monolithic Node.js app to a fast Go microservices at my first job. I still enjoy Go every day, whether I’m tuning a web API or a tool CLI or Writing code in C and Go for Raspberry Pi projects. I live on Linux, code in Neovim, use Nix wherever I can, and keep CI pipelines humming with GitHub or GitLab Actions before shipping to AWS, Hetzner, or Cloudflare.

At university I am currently focusing on parallel computing and robotics, and after hours I tinker with game ideas.

Feel free to reach out to me on GitHub, LinkedIn, or by email at ali@rostami.me.
