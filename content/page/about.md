Hello! I'm Ali Rostami. I am a software developer. I am currently pursuing my
Master's degree. My love for computers started when I first experienced the joy
of playing video games. Back then I was always fighting my brothers for a chance
to use our shared computer. I learned to do cool stuff in Microsoft Excel and
Powerpoint using
[Visual Basic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)>) to
impress my friends at school when we had to give class presentations or field
research. At 15 I learned to write C/C++ programs and designed an Arduino‑based
alarm system for my dad's garden.

Since then I have experimented with many technologies and development stacks, I
have built React websites and Node.js services. At my first job I was a key part
of the team that carried-out the migration from a monolithic Node.js application
to a distributed Go system. I developed some of the most sensetive services in
that system such as financing, billing, payment, and driver routing.

I still enjoy writing Go every day, whether I’m working on a web API or a CLI
tool or even an automation that does not fit in Bash. Currently, as a Research
Assistant, I mostly work with C++ and Matlab on high-performance computing and
simulation projects. [I work and live on Linux](linux-journey), code in Neovim,
and automate everything with Bash or Python scripts.

At University I am currently focusing on parallel computing, computer graphics,
and computer vision. After hours I tinker with game development ideas, home
automation, or hardware related stuff.
