    'A detailed overview of my Linux development environment and tools.'

I have been using Linux as the primary operting system of my personal and work
computers from 2018. I had tried Linux before that and actually liked it very
much but I've always found a deal breaker that made me switch back to Windows,
either the software/games that I was using did not work on Linux or I managed to
nuke something in my system that I could not fix at the time.

The first distribution I fully commited to was Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. Since then the
only time I used Windows was when I wanted to play video games. Fortunately,
with the help of [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) and
[Proton](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_(software)>) I do not even need
windows to play video games anymore and have removed Windows entirely from my
machines.

I have used various Linux distributions over the years including
[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/),
[EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/), [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/),
and currently I am using [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/) on my personal
computers and [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) on my servers. I have made crazy
customized [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) and [Swaywm](https://swaywm.org/) setups
over the years and exclusively used tiling window managers for a long time but
recently I have switched back to stock [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) desktop
environment for simplicity and reliability.

Following the move to a more stable and reliable system I have also switched to
atomic distributions, first
[Fedora Silverblue](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/silverblue/) and
now [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/). I use [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/)
for GUI applications and [Podman](https://podman.io/) containers for CLI
applications. I do my development work inside containers as well using
[Distrobox](https://distrobox.it/). This setup allows me to have a stable base
system that does not break with updates while still being able to use the latest
tools and libraries for development.
