# Handwriting Recognition in C++

Welcome to the Handwriting Recognition project, an educational initiative to explore neural networks using the MNIST dataset in modern C++. This project demonstrates memory-safe programming practices and leverages state-of-the-art C++ features. For an in-depth look at the underlying memory models and safety mechanisms, check out my [blog post on C++ memory models](https://alirostami.me/blog/cpp-memory-models-how-modern-cpp-manages-memory-safety/).

The code for this project can be found on [Github](https://github.com/alirostami1/handwriting-recognition).

## Overview

This project aims to:
- Familiarize with neural networks and handwriting recognition.
- Utilize modern C++ for enhanced performance and memory safety.
- Provide a modular and maintainable codebase that leverages best practices in C++.

The project uses the popular MNIST dataset to train and test a neural network that recognizes handwritten digits.


## Features

- **Modern C++ Implementation:** Built with modern C++ standards for robust and efficient code.
- **Memory Safety:** Focus on secure memory management and performance.
- **Configurable Training:** Easily adjustable parameters via a configuration file.
- **OpenMP Support:** Optional OpenMP support for enhanced parallelism during training.
